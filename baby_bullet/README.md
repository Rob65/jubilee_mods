# Baby bullet modifications

## orbiter tool plate

The orbiter tool plate is a modified version of the standard tool plate for the baby bullet.
Instead of using 3D printed cups and threaded balls, this version uses regular (stainless) steel balls that are pressed into the cups in the aluminum plate

When producing this plate, make sure the holes for the balls are 10  to 20 Âµm under nominal size to be able to press the balls in without too much force.
The balls should be pressed in to final depth. This is a height of 10.9 mm from the back of the plate.

## 3D printing models

I mostly use these M3 inserts: https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/tools-and-mounting/installation-and-mounting-material/threaded-inserts/threaded-insert-m3-4.0mm-20-pieces
The small diameter is 4.0 mm so I changed the design to use 4.1 mm holes. This makes the inserts well seated without too much bulging of the surrounding material.

You only need to print the front base piece just once. The -v2 is for the Orbiter 2.0, the other one is for Orbiter 1.5
